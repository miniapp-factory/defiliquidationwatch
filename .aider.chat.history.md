The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized shield icon representing protection, featuring a subtle green and blue gradient. Inside the shield, a simple line graph rises upward, with a small dollar sign at the peak, symbolizing financial monitoring and growth. The background is a clean white, giving the logo a modern, professional look suitable for a DeFi monitoring app.
